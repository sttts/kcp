c "First we take the role of an API service provider. Our running example is cert-manager. We want to offer that to users of the kcp service."
c "We create a workspace for cert-manager to export the APIs from:"
pe "kubectl kcp workspace create cert-manager-service --use"

c "Then we need an APIResourceSchema. That's very similar to a CRD, actually like a snapshot of a CRD at a point in time:"
pe "cat ${DEMO_DIR}/apibinding/certificate-apiresourceschema.yaml"
pe "kubectl apply -f ${DEMO_DIR}/apibinding/certificate-apiresourceschema.yaml"

c "Now we export the API to make it available for users of the kcp service:"
pe "cat ${DEMO_DIR}/apibinding/cert-manager-apiexport.yaml"
pe "kubectl apply -f ${DEMO_DIR}/apibinding/cert-manager-apiexport.yaml"
c "Note that it references our APIResourceSchema, more concretely today's version. In the future, we might want to have another version and roll that out to customers."

c "Let's see the APIExport status:"
pe "kubectl get apiexports"

c "Let's also register a physical cluster, to make sure that the APIs we need are available."
pe "kubectl apply -f contrib/demo/clusters/kind/us-east1.yaml"

c "Let's apply the CRDs required by cert-manager:"
pe "kubectl apply -f ${DEMO_DIR}/apibinding/cert-manager-crds.yaml"
