c "First we take the role of an API service provider. Our running example is cert-manager. We want to offer that to users of the kcp service."
c "We create a workspace for cert-manager to export the APIs from:"
pe "kubectl kcp workspace create cert-manager-service --use"

c "Then we need an APIResourceSchema. That's very similar to a CRD, actually like a snapshot of a CRD at a point in time:"
pe "cat ${DEMO_DIR}/apibinding/certificate-apiresourceschema.yaml"
pe "kubectl apply -f ${DEMO_DIR}/apibinding/certificate-apiresourceschema.yaml"

c "Now we export the API to make it available for users of the kcp service:"
pe "cat ${DEMO_DIR}/apibinding/cert-manager-apiexport.yaml"
pe "kubectl apply -f ${DEMO_DIR}/apibinding/cert-manager-apiexport.yaml"

c "Now we swtich roles. We are the customer now, in need of certificate generation for our web application. We are lucky: kcp has a cert-manager service ðŸŽ‰"

c "We bind to the cert-manager API by creating an APIBinding:"
pe "cat ${DEMO_DIR}/apibinding/cert-manager-apibinding.yaml"
c "Note that we choose the stable version. There might be a cutting-edge APIExport too."
pe "kubectl apply -f ${DEMO_DIR}/apibinding/cert-manager-apibinding.yaml"

c "The kcp system will do the binding now in the background and make the APIs available:"
pe "kubectl get apibinding -o yaml"

pe "kubectl get apibinding -o yaml"
c "We see it is bound and ready. We should now see the Certificate API available ðŸ¤ž:"

c "Note that this is much more than just a CRD: we have bound to the whole cert-manager service. So certificate requests will actually work ðŸŽ‰"
