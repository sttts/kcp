// Placement defines a selection rule to choose ONE location for MULTIPLE namespaces in a workspace.
//
// placement is in Pending state initially. When a location is selected by the placement, the placement
// turns to Unbound state. In Pending or Unbound state, the selection rule can be updated to select another location.
// When the a namespace is annotated by another controller or user with the key of "scheduling.kcp.dev/placement",
// the namespace will pick one placement, and this placement is transferred to Bound state. Any update to spec of the placement
// is ignored in Bound state and reflected in the conditions. The placement will turn back to Unbound state when no namespace
// uses this placement any more.
